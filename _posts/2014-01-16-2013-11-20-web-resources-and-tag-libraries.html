<p>The Servlet 3.0 specification defines a way for any JAR in a web application to provide resources that can be accessed via a URL. This is especially useful for tag libraries since the markup generated by tags will require CSS and JavaScript resources to be included in each page a tag is used.</p>
<p>The directory in each JAR that is exposed is 'META-INF/resources'. Any files in this directory are accessible just like resources in the root of the WAR. Which leads to...</p>
<h2>JSPs in JARs</h2>
<p>JSP files in META-INF/resources also get the special treatment. This allows you to package your application as a set of JARs. This is useful&nbsp;if there are multiple customers and a set of features are customized for each one. The JSPs and action classes that provide the default behavior can be packaged as a shared JAR. The customizations can override the defaults. The servlet spec states that resources in the WAR will override any resources in a JAR when they have the same context relative path.</p>
<h2>Example Application</h2>
<p>I have created GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftelan/modular-webapp">project</a>&nbsp;that demonstrates web resources in JARs. The application does require a Servlet 3.0 environment such as <a target="_blank" href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi">Tomcat 7</a>. To build the project execute:</p>
<pre class="source-code">mvn package</pre>
<p><span style="line-height:1.6em">The application can be accessed at </span><a target="_blank" style="line-height: 1.6em;" href="http://localhost:8080/web-app/Index.action">http://localhost:8080/web-app/Index.action</a><span style="line-height:1.6em">.</span></p>
